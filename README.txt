How to Use:


1. Click the browse button
2. Find the folder filled with music you would like to play and hopefully listen to
3. From there, just use the tools available to you to navigate the music.

Eventually, you will be able to add music through the application. This will be done through enclosing youtube within the window. Once the
individual navigates to the video they want with the song they want, it will download it to your newly created playlist.
